## Background
We will be creating a marketplace where sellers or various sizes can come together to sell to a diverse customer base.We are going to create a web-based software application where marketplace sellers have a platform not only to sell their products but also to provide customers the opportunity to buy these products while comparing the prices from various sellers.

## Problem Statement
he reason we wanted to take on this project is because sellers have a hard time marketing their products and most of the time customers arenâ€™t even aware that they could purchase products from these sellers. This has been a loss to both the customers and sellers because the customers are forced to buy products that are much more expensive than the rates these marketplace sellers offer and the sellers have no means of attracting these customers.  We want to create a software application that could interpret information in a new way and to solve this problem for both the sellers and the customers.  The main business need of our project is to offer these marketplace sellers a direct path to selling their products to the customers
