## Background
Trading has been around since ancient time, from travelling markets to city hubs. In, current times with the transition to technology so has the trading of goods. Currently they is a large gap between buyers and sellers, so with this marketplace we are going to bridge that gap. On this marketplace, sellers can reach a larger audience. And buyers can access competitive prices and quality..

## Problem Statement
The reason we wanted to take on this project is because sellers have a hard time marketing their products and most of the time customers aren’t even aware that they could purchase products from these sellers. This has been a loss to both the customers and sellers because the customers are forced to buy products that are much more expensive than the rates these marketplace sellers offer and the sellers have no means of attracting these customers.  We want to create a software application that could interpret information in a new way and to solve this problem for both the sellers and the customers.  The main business need of our project is to offer these marketplace sellers a direct path to selling their products to the customers
